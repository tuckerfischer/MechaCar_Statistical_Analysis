From our analysis we determined that vehicle length, vehicle width, and ground clearence all had significant impacts on the MPG of a car (p<0.5). The slope is not zero as these values do not correlate to MPG perfectlt. This model does predict MPG as we have three values that are statistically significant in having an impact on MPG.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

All the lots combined meet the requirement that the suspension not exceed a 100 lb/inch^2 however, lot 3 does exceed this requirement.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

When doing the first t-test for all the combined lots the PSI is not significantly different (p>0.5) from the population mean of 1500 PSI. Both lots 1 and 2 were individualy not significantly different from the population mean as well. However, lot 3 was significantly different from the population mean with a mean of 1496.14 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
